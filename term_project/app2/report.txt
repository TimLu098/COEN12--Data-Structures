Time Complexity:

createDataSet: O(n)

deleteDataSet: O(1)

searchID: O(1)

insert: O(1)

delete: O(1)


The data structure used in this program was an 
array. This was chosen becasue the student max 
was 3000 with each having to contain a unique id.
This scenerio will do frequent search, and infrequent 
insert and delete.Hence, I use hash table to implement
this scenerio, because it will have O(1) instead of O(n)
if it compare to using linked list to do search.
