Time Complexities:

createDataSet() :  Ｏ(1)
destroyDataSet():  Ｏ(1)
searchAge():       Ｏ(n)
searchId():        Ｏ(n)
insertion():       Ｏ(1)
deletion():        Ｏ(n)
maxAgeGap():       Ｏ(1)



In this scenrio, we will perform frequent insertion and deletion, 
but the search operation is not performed frequently.
So I choose to use linked list to implement this application, 
because we will only have O(1) for the insertion and Ｏ(n) for deletion. 
This is better than using hash table, because we will have insertion as Ｏ(n)
instead of Ｏ(1) if we use hash table. 



used an array of structures to maintain student records of id and age. 
The number if maximum students is not provided,
